Recipe Spelunker
================

Combination infinite-spelunking, Minecraft-like world, and dark storyline.

Lab 17 is researching the depths of the earth, a project led by Dr. Cantanker. The project recently has consisted of hiring interns, sending them down the 30 billion meter shaft with a camera, and hoping for the best - unfortunately, this hasn't been working very well. The only bright side is that the project is well below budget - nonr of the interns have earned any salary.

A memo has just arrived - lab 14 has discovered a way to clone living organisms, and Dr. Cantanker thinks he knows how to deal with the constant loss of interns. Over the next few days, the staff at lab 17 work on their existing cloning technology sent over from lab 20 and modify it per lab 14's instructions. Finally, they only have to teach the interns to say "spelunking" instead of "caving" once, and then everyone that gets sent down will remember.

## Compiling/Building/Distributing
If you don't want to wait for an official build, or you already know that an official build is not planned to be made for your platform, then you can uild the project manually. **DO NOT DISTRIBUTE _ANY_ BUILDS OR BINARIES**, whether you made them or not. You can always link to official builds, but do not distribute them. Likewise, don't accept non-official or redistributed builds or binaries. If you can provide clear instruction on how to create a build for a certain platform, you can ask for it to become a platform fot the official builds.
